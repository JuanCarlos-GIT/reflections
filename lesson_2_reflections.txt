What happens when you initialize a repository? why do you need to do it?

    That is the way that Git will track the history of my files

How is the staging are different from the working directory and the repository? What 
value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is a previous stage before commiting; it would be use to make sure all the 
    required files are in the commit before going into the repository which will keep a log or
    history of our versions. The woking directory is where many changes take place on the file
    until a version is good enough to be commited

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?

    I would use the command 'git diff --staged' to make sure that my file or files related are 
    ready and regrouped for an specific commit or logical change. 

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized?

What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
    Merging to branches helps mantain all the commits from the master and the new_branch and the way
    they are represented is because the commits happen in parallel until the merge


What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
    Git helps with most of the merge because usually 2 developer shouldn't work on the same line of code
