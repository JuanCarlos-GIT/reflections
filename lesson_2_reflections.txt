What happens when you initialize a repository? why do you need to do it?

    That is the way that Git will track the history of my files

How is the staging are different from the working directory and the repository? What 
value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is a previous stage before commiting; it would be use to make sure all the 
    required files are in the commit before going into the repository which will keep a log or
    history of our versions. The woking directory is where many changes take place on the file
    until a version is good enough to be commited
