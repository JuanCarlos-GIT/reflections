When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
    I would want to use it as a project with different collaborators



Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
    Because I have the control of when I can get the latest changes from the GitHub


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
    Fork is a type of clone only usable via GitHub, clone is use to copy a repository from GitHub to a local machine. Branches are local copies of the master to experiment with new feature.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
    Benefit of knowing if the repositories are out of sync
