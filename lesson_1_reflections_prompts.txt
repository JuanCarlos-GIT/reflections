How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It was easier to spot

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can spot changes over time.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    As a programmer there are many versions before finding the right code

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    because many file could be related and we need the history of them as a group.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can find the id of the commits and then use git diff to check differences between them.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    If I am able to come back to a previous version that works well I'll be more confident

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I would like to start new project and sell the idea to investors
